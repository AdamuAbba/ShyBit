## BLOCK CONSTRUCTOR

This task will give you a chance to showcase your abilities and give us a sense of how you approach problems and write code. The challenge is open-ended and allows for multiple approaches.

### The problem

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of transactions from their mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:

- includes a fee which is collected by the miner if that transaction is included in a block
- has a weight, which indicates the size of the transaction
- may have one or more parent transactions which are also in the mempool

The miner selects an ordered list of transactions that have a combined weight below the maximum block weight. Transactions with parent transactions in the mempool may be included in the list, but only if all of their parents appear before them in the list.

Naturally, the miner would like to include the transactions that maximize the total fee.

Your task is to write a program that reads a file mempool.csv, with the format:

`<txid>`,`<fee>`,`<weight>`,`<parent_txids>`

`txid` is the transaction identifier
`fee` is the transaction fee
`weight` is the transaction weight
`parent_txids` is a list of the txids of the transactionâ€™s immediate parent transactions in the mempool. Ancestors that are not immediate parents (eg parents of parents) and parent transactions already in the chain are not included in this list. It is of the form: `<txid1>;<txid2>;...`

The output from the program should be txids, separated by newlines, which make a valid block, maximizing the fee to the miner. Transactions MUST appear in order. No transaction should
